        <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between <br> two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. </p>
        <h2>Ingridients: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li>Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li> Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
            <li>Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add flour, milk, and vegetable oil and mix to combine. <br> Whisk in sugar, then mix in baking powder, salt, and vanilla just until smooth, being careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Spray the preheated waffle iron with nonstick spray. Pour batter onto the hot waffle iron and cook until golden brown <br> and the iron stops steaming, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
